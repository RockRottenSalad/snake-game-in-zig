# (bad)-snake-game-in-zig

New year, new language, haven't coded in Zig before, so I decided to make a snake game in Zig with Raylib.
<br><br>
Since I'm not familiar with the syntax, I spent a lot of time fighting the compiler, and as one might imagine, ended up writing some very hideous code.
So if you're also new to Zig and you're looking to learn something from this... then **don't** :)
<br><br>
At least it works(sorta)
<br><br>

##Known bug:
<br>
- pressing 2 direction keys within 1 tick(can be fixed with a simple debounce but I'm too worn out from "Zigging")
